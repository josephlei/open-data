##Sacramento Open Data
###Sharing the data cornucopia

This repo contains the results of some of the data research work I have done using the City of Sacramento Open Data Portal located at http://portal.cityofsacramento.org/opendata

To create your own visualizations:
* Create a free account at www.cartodb.com
* Download the raw .csv file and upload it to cartodb OR link cartodb directly to the .csv file from github!
* Create a new visualization
* Play with filters, sql, labels, infoboxes, basemaps and wizards, i.e. GO HAM!
* Create a github fork, upload your awesome work and submit a pull request so we can show the world all the awesome work you did with Open Data!


All of this would not be possible without the generous support, teaching and mentorship of my local Code for Sacramento Team Members, the Sacramento Hacker Lab and the foundational work of Jay Venti's python parser.
