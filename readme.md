##Sacramento Open Data
###Sharing the data cornucopia

This repo contains the results of some of the data research work I have done using the City of Sacramento Open Data Portal located at http://portal.cityofsacramento.org/opendata

All of this would not be possible without the generous support, teaching and mentorship of my local Code for Sacramento Team Members, the Sacramento Hacker Lab and the foundational work of Jay Venti's python parser.
