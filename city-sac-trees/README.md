1. Based on data from the City of Sacramento Open Data Portal located at http://data.cityofsacramento.org/home/
2. Data set has been parsed from the Junar KML format into a standard flat CSV file using python script written by Jay Venti, located here: https://github.com/code4sac/city-data-portal-conversion
